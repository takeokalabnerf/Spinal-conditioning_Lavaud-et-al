# Two distinct inhibitory neuronal classes govern acquisition and recall of spinal sensorimotor learning
## Figure replication

### Step 1: Data
All the data you need to run this cord are stored under:
> ConditioningExample/DataExp1/Day1/pair1

It is made of three raw kinematic files returning the position of 5 joints (Foot, ankle, knee, hip and crest) along the three axis X, Y and Z

### Step 2: Format the kinematic component of each joint and for Learner and Control
In order to separate Learner and Control kinematics and to remove the potential artefact from the dataset, run:
```sh
sorting_raw_kinematic_file.m
```
It will save the formatted kinematics in:
> ConditioningExample/DataExp1/AnalyseDay1/pair1.

### Step 3: From the kinematics, extract foot position
First thing before going further, you need to load the predetermined height threshold, along the Z axis, for all the trial you want to analyse. For this, just load the matlab file:
```sh
ThrshDay
```
which is generated by the matlab code 
```sh
threshold_files.m
```
#### During the 10 minutes trial
For plotting the position of the foot during the 10min trial, you will need to run:
```sh
Plot_kinematic_10min_experiments
```
#### During the withdrawal of the foot
